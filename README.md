Dining Philosophers with Java Monitors
======================================

Getting the files:
------------------
On the lab computers, use the command:

    git clone git://github.com/cwru-eecs338/java_monitors.git

Running the code:
-----------------
1. Run the `ant` command to compile the Java and create an executable JAR file
2. Execute the JAR file with the command `./main.jar`
3. You can use optional arguments to change the number of philosophers and the duration of the program in seconds. For example, `./main.jar 25 10` will run the program with 25 philosophers for 10 seconds.

Lessons:
--------
* Using monitors and the `synchronized` keyword in Java.
* Observe an implementation for a solution to the dining philosophers problem.
* Basic multi-threading in Java (optional)
